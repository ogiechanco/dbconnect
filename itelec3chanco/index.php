    <h1>HI,<br/>
    I'm Rogelio

    <h5>3rd year student</h5>

    <h1>My Story</h1>
    <p>I'm Rogelio Jr M. Chanco, currently a student at Colegio De Sta. Teresa De Avila, pursuing a Bachelor of 
        Science in Information Technology (BSIT). In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and basketball.

    I chose to study BSIT because I wanted to build my own computer setup. However, as I’ve been learning, 
    I’ve developed a passion for programming. This has inspired me to pursue a career as a web developer or 
    in any field related to programming.
